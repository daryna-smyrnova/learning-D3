here I am learning D3.js visualisation library, I am trying to combine it with exploration of networkx package

Data for the Game of Thrones, as well as the scripts come from the Game of Thrones project on DataCamp
https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/76

It relies on an underlying course on Network Analysis, given by Eric Ma
https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-network-analysis-in-python

Which in it's turn relies on NetworkX package for network analysis (also written by Eric Ma)
